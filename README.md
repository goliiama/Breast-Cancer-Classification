# Breast Cancer Classification

## Overview
This project classifies breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset is utilized, focusing on achieving high accuracy through effective data preprocessing and model training.

## Installation
Install the necessary packages:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Data Preprocessing
Steps include:

Handling missing values
Encoding categorical variables
Normalizing features
Splitting data into training and test sets

## Modeling
An SVM is used for classification, chosen for its effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces and robustness to overfitting.

## Evaluation
Performance metrics include:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1 Score
Confusion Matrix

## Results
The SVM model achieved high accuracy in classifying breast cancer tumors. Detailed results are available in the notebook.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the successful application of SVM in breast cancer classification, with potential for clinical use. Future work could explore other algorithms and feature selection methods.
